To top is all of, all app now runs in super retina mode for iPad Pro 12.9 inch.

EXPECT UI GLITCHES, but if some app doesn't work, just launch it again in full screen mode.

The fork includes arm64e (A12+) support, just needed to modify the makefile. A precompiled deb file is in the packages folder, named com.a12x.requirefull_0.0.2-1+debug_iphoneos-arm.deb 

Thanks for @Jakeashacks for help with compiling and Theos Installer 2
